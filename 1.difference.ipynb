    "React Native and Expo are both tools for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React, but they differ in their approach, setup, and features. Here's a concise breakdown of their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Overview**\n",
    "- **React Native**: A framework developed by Facebook for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It allows direct access to native platform features (iOS/Android) and compiles to native code.\n",
    "- **Expo**: A framework and platform built on top of React Native that simplifies the development process by providing a managed environment, pre-built tools, and a set of APIs for common features.\n",

    "### 2. **Key Differences**\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Aspect**                | **React Native**                                                                 | **Expo**                                                                 |\n",
    "|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Setup**                 | Requires setting up a native development environment (Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android). More complex and time-consuming. | Simplified setup. No need for native development tools; uses Expo CLI and a managed workflow. |\n",
    "| **Development Workflow**  | **Bare Workflow**: Full control over native code, allowing integration of custom native modules. | **Managed Workflow**: Abstracts native code; uses Expo's pre-built APIs and tools. Also offers a **Bare Workflow** for more control. |\n",
    "| **Access to Native APIs** | Direct access to all native APIs and third-party native libraries, but may require writing native code (Swift/Java/Kotlin). | Limited to Expo's pre-built APIs. Custom native modules require ejecting to a bare workflow. |\n",
    "| **Build Process**         | Developers manage builds, signing, and deployment manually using tools like Xcode or Gradle. | Expo handles builds and deployment via its cloud services (Expo Application Services, EAS). |\n",
    "| **Ease of Use**           | Steeper learning curve due to native environment setup and configuration.         | Beginner-friendly, with faster setup and simplified development process. |\n",
    "| **Over-the-Air Updates**  | Requires third-party solutions (e.g., CodePush) for OTA updates.                 | Built-in OTA updates for quick deployment of JavaScript and asset updates. |\n",
    "| **Performance**           | Slightly better performance since it allows fine-tuned native integrations.       | Slightly slower due to the abstraction layer, but negligible for most apps. |\n",
    "| **Ejecting**              | Not applicable; already a bare setup.                                            | Can \"eject\" to a bare React Native project if more native control is needed. |\n",
    "| **Library Support**       | Supports any React Native-compatible library, including those requiring native code. | Limited to libraries compatible with Expo's managed workflow unless ejected. |\n",
    "| **Cost**                  | Free and open-source, but developers manage infrastructure costs.                | Free tier available; some features (e.g., EAS builds) require paid plans. |\n",

    "### 3. **When to Use**\n",
    "- **React Native**:\n",
    "  - Choose if you need full control over native code or specific native modules not supported by Expo.\n",
    "  - Ideal for complex apps requiring deep platform-specific integrations (e.g., custom hardware interactions).\n",
    "  - Suitable for teams with experience in native development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expo**:\n",
    "  - Choose for rapid prototyping, simpler apps, or if you're new to mobile development.\n",
    "  - Great for apps that don't require complex native integrations and benefit from Expo's APIs (e.g., camera, push notifications).\n",
    "  - Preferred for projects needing fast iteration and OTA updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Examples**\n",
    "- **React Native**: Apps like Instagram, Airbnb, and Walmart use React Native for its flexibility and native performance.\n",
    "- **Expo**: Smaller apps, MVPs, or projects like those built during hackathons often use Expo for its simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **React Native** is a powerful, flexible framework for building native apps with full control but requires more setup and native knowledge.\n",
    "- **Expo** is a layer on top of React Native that simplifies development with a managed workflow, ideal for faster development but with some limitations on native access.\n",
