    "To create projects in **React Native** and **Expo**, you need to set up their respective environments and use specific commands. Below, I’ll outline the steps and commands for creating a new project in both frameworks, assuming you have a basic development environment (Node.js, npm, etc.) already set up. I'll keep it concise and focused on the commands and key setup steps.\n",

    "### **1. Creating a React Native Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**:\n",
    "- Install **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended).\n",
    "- Install **React Native CLI**: Run `npm install -g react-native`.\n",
    "- For iOS: Install **Xcode** (macOS only, for iOS simulator/builds).\n",
    "- For Android: Install **Android Studio** and set up an Android emulator or device.\n",
    "- Ensure you have **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 11 or higher) for Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Create a React Native Project**:\n",
    "1. **Initialize a new project**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npx react-native init MyReactNativeApp\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a new project called `MyReactNativeApp` with a basic React Native structure.\n",
    "   - Replace `MyReactNativeApp` with your desired project name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to the project directory**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd MyReactNativeApp\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the app**:\n",
    "   - **For iOS** (macOS only):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     npx react-native run-ios\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This builds and runs the app in the iOS simulator.\n",
    "   - **For Android**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     npx react-native run-android\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - Ensure an Android emulator is running or a device is connected via USB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- The `init` command sets up a bare React Native project with native code (iOS and Android folders).\n",
    "- You may need to configure environment variables (e.g., `ANDROID_HOME` for Android).\n",
    "- Use `npm start` or `npx react-native start` to start the Metro bundler separately if needed.\n",

    "### **2. Creating an Expo Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**:\n",
    "- Install **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended).\n",
    "- Install **Expo CLI**: Run `npm install -g expo-cli`.\n",
    "- Optionally, install the **Expo Go** app on your iOS/Android device for quick testing.\n",
    "- No native development tools (Xcode or Android Studio) are required for the managed workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Create an Expo Project**:\n",
    "1. **Initialize a new project**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npx create-expo-app MyExpoApp\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a new project called `MyExpoApp` using the Expo managed workflow.\n",
    "   - Replace `MyExpoApp` with your desired project name.\n",
    "   - You may be prompted to choose a template (e.g., blank, TypeScript, etc.). For a basic setup, select the **blank** template:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     npx create-expo-app MyExpoApp --template blank\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to the project directory**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd MyExpoApp\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the app**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npx expo start\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This starts the Expo development server and displays a QR code.\n",
    "   - Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your iOS/Android device to run the app.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, press:\n",
    "     - `i` to open in an iOS simulator (requires Xcode on macOS).\n",
    "     - `a` to open in an Android emulator (requires Android Studio).\n",
    "     - `w` to run in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- Expo’s managed workflow abstracts native code, so you don’t need Xcode or Android Studio unless you eject to a bare workflow.\n",
    "- Use `npx expo install <package>` to add Expo-compatible libraries.\n",
    "- For production builds, use `eas build` (requires an Expo account and EAS setup).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Differences in Setup**\n",
    "- **React Native**: Requires native tools (Xcode, Android Studio) and manual configuration, giving you full control over native code.\n",
    "- **Expo**: Simplifies setup with no native tools required for managed workflow, but limits you to Expo’s APIs unless you eject.\n",
